# BMDA-Simulation

Simulation code, data, and results are provided in the files for BMDA versus competing methods of ANCOM-BC, LEfSe, edgeR, and DESeq2 

1.  Code/Code contains functions in R and C++ necessary for the simulation.
2.  Code: false_discovery_code.R and power_fdr_code.R recreate the plots in the paper.
3.  Simulated Data: contains the simulated Weiss data
4.  Simulation Results: contains the results of all methods for both the simulated data and the permuted simulated data.
